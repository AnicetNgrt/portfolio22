            After ranking 7th at a hackathon in April 2022, my team of fellow CS students and I, decided to launch a startup aiming to develop a state of the art decentralized exchange for the NEAR blockchain.
            <br>
            Choosing NEAR for its fast growth potential and low energy consumption, this entrepreneurship journey made me go above and beyond my comfort zone. 
            <br>
            For instance, I lead the frontend engineering, design and branding of a MVP for 1 month during the hackathon, with cutting edge technologies such as SvelteKit and Rust. 
            <br>
            Then I did the same thing for the private beta version released 4 months after the hackathon, including many new features, design iterations and redesigning the whole branding and app 2 times of my own.
            <br>
            I also built and designed a landing page that brought 2.5k users to our private beta.
            <br>
            Then, I pitched the project in front of 50+ people during a business trip at NEAR CON 2022 in Lisbon. There, I established some useful & lasting business contacts.
            <br>
            Since November, I voluntarily stepped down from my co-founding and CTO roles, seeking a better work and studies balance. From then on, I'll only be giving expertise to the team and maintaining the Frontend codebase, trying to perfect the user-facing part of the product towards the big public release.
            <br>
            In conclusion: Although I want to use my skills in other fields than web3 and blockchain in the future, I learned so much about business, profesional relationships, team work, blockchain, and of course, software development during this journey.
