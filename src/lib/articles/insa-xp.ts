After graduating from my two years technical Computer Science degree at Université de Paris Rives de Seine, I got admited to INSA de Lyon in Computer Science engineering, based on my curriculum.

INSA de Lyon is amongst the largest and top engineering schools in France. It is located near the beautiful city of Lyon, not far from where I now live.

There I got the chance to study Computer Science engineering from top researchers in the field, broadening my understanding and my network.

I would advice anyone wanting to study CS in France to go studying there. The campus life is very mature and active, something quite rare, almost unique, amongst French Computer Science engineering schools according to the various testimonies I have from people studying elsewhere. 

The courses are good, broadening the scope and the scale of what I studied in my technical college before, while not being overwhelming (in some departments at least, including the Computer Science one, according to my fellow students from other departments).

Opportunities to learn new things, live new experiences, get cool worldwide internship and exchanges, and meet talented young folks are plenty. And since the school is public, it's not so expensive. (For now at least...) Anyone that had top grades in highschool (I did not) or during his previous studies (I did), can probably get accepted.

Furthermore, every year at INSA I have an opportunity for an internship. Last year was in Lomé, Togo, teaching orphans how to use computers and doing mobile back-end development for a local non-profit. In 2023, I will go to Paris at OnePoint for a Data-Science project (tbd).

Lyon is an overall well thought city, plenty to do, plenty to see. The public transportation offer is satisfying, and the distances from any point to any other point of the city are mostly short, so you can even go on foot or on bike, quite unlike Paris.

At INSA I also met the people with whom I built [farswap](https://farswap.org), a DeFi startup, and my first startup ever, giving me the opportunity to travel for business and networking to Lisbon in 2023. [You can read about this story here.](/blog/farswap-xp)
