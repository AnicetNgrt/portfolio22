After graduating from my two years technical Computer Science degree at Université de Paris Rives de Seine, I got admited to INSA de Lyon in Computer Science engineering, based on my curriculum.

INSA de Lyon is amongst the largest and top engineering schools in France. It is located near the beautiful city of Lyon, not far from where I now live.

There I got the chance to study a more theoretical and broader approach to Computer Science engineering than during my technical degree. And also meet incredible people.

I would advice anyone wanting to study CS in France to go studying there. The campus life is surprisingly developed and active, something quite rare, almost unique, amongst French Computer Science engineering schools, according to the various testimonies I have from CS students studying in other schools. Arts, theater, sports, music, and many other clubs are available. I personally joined the books reading and rock dancing club, with absolutely no regrets.

The courses are interesting, deepening the scope of what I studied in my technical college before, while not being overwhelming (in the Computer Science departement at least). I was able to get back to real maths and not struggle too much despite how little I studied math previously compared to other students.

Opportunities to learn new things, experience worldwide exchanges, and meet talented young folks are plenty. And since the school is public, it's not so expensive. Anyone that had top grades in highschool (I did not) or during his previous studies (I did), has a chance to get accepted.

Furthermore, every year at INSA I have an opportunity for an internship. Last year was in Lomé, Togo, teaching orphans how to use computers and doing mobile back-end development for a local non-profit. In 2023, I will go to Paris at OnePoint for a Data-Science related project (tbd).

Lyon is an overall well thought city, plenty to do, plenty to see. The public transportation offer is satisfying, and the distances from any point to any other point of the city are mostly short, so you can even go on foot or on bike, quite unlike Paris.

At INSA I also met the people with whom I built [farswap](https://farswap.org), a DeFi startup, and my first startup ever, giving me the opportunity to travel for business and networking to Lisbon in 2023. [You can read about this story here.](/blog/farswap-xp)
