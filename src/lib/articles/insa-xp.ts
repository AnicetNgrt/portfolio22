After graduating from my two years technical Computer Science degree at Université de Paris Rives de Seine, I got admited to INSA de Lyon in Computer Science engineering, based on my curriculum.

INSA de Lyon is amongst the largest and top engineering schools in France. It is located near the beautiful city of Lyon, not far from where I now live.

At INSA de Lyon I got the chance to study Computer Science engineering from top researchers in the field, broadening my understanding and my network.

Every year at INSA I have an opportunity for an internship. Last year was in Lomé, Togo, teaching orphans how to use computers and doing mobile back-end development for a local non-profit. In 2023, I will go to Paris at OnePoint for a Data-Science project (tbd).

At INSA I also met the people with whom I built [farswap](https://farswap.org), a DeFi startup, and my first startup ever, giving me the opportunity to travel for business and networking to Lisbon in 2023.
